# CRUD-App

**Secure CRUD Application with Node.js, React, and MSSQL (Under Development)**

**Description:**

This is a web-based application under active development that empowers users with secure Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities on an MSSQL database.

**Key Features (Current):**

- **Admin-only Login:** Ensures authorized access to the application. (Further user roles can be implemented in the future)
- **Secure Data Connection:** Connects securely to your MSSQL server to safeguard data integrity.
- **Dynamic Data Fetching:** Executes user-specified SQL queries on the fly, retrieving relevant data from the database.
- **Interactive Homepage:** Provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the fetched data. (Visualizations, filtering, sorting, etc. can be added later)

**Planned Features (Future):**

- **CRUD Operations:** Enable seamless creation, editing, and deletion of records within the SQL database.
- **Enhanced User Interface:** Design an intuitive and visually appealing interface for CRUD operations.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to provide informative feedback to users.
- **Scalability:** Incorporate strategies to handle increased data volume and user traffic (consider pagination, caching, etc.).

**Technology Stack:**

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
